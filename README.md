### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I live in Philadelphia and work as a multi-disciplinary software engineer &
designer. I'm currently a Software Engineer at ~Warner Bros. Discovery
focused on [HBO Max](https://www.hbomax.com/)~ [Samsara](https://samsara.com)
focused on cloud infrastructure and platform engineering.

Over the years, I've developed front end web applications, created backend
microservices and REST APIs, automated cloud infrastructure management, and
built continuous deployment pipelines for large-scale, highly available
distributed systems. I like using and contributing to open source software.

I've also worked in graphic and UX design, and as an artist. Prints of my
visual work can be purchased at [Tiendah](https://tiendah.bigcartel.com).
